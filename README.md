# RankingTroll

The finality of this project is to see how many github users rankings can be fooled just by pushing a empty new commit each 15 minutes.
To make this something more interesting, the commit messages are being generated by a  Multi-layer Recurrent Neural that have being trained with several examples of commits messages. 

## Has you ranking been troll?

Dude, Seriously?, To avoid this easy kind of cheating, you may want to use any other metric for you ranking.

Some suggestions are:
* Number of pull requests
* Lines of code
* Forks
* Starts

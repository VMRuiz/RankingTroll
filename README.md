# RankingTroll

The finality of this project is to see how many github users rankings can be fooled just by pushing a empty new commit each 15 minutes.
To make this more interesting, the commit messages are been generated by a  Multi-layer Recurrent Neural that have being trained with several examples of commits messages. 

## Has you ranking been troll?

Dude, Seriously?, To avoid this easy kind of cheating, you may want to use any other metric for you ranking.

Some suggestions are:
* Number of pull requests
* Lines of code
* Forks
* Starts

## Future Work

The author is suffering an ethical dilemma about introduce fake-code generation too, it may be implemented in the future if the idea receive enough support.

## Legal Aspects

## Does Github allow you to do this?
Frankly, I don't know. I try without success to find anything like this case in the user term of the site, so I did it. 
Please, MR. Github, if you don't like this, just tell me to take it down.
